# Work Sessions Page Fix

## Issues Fixed

1. **Namespace Organization**: Reordered imports in the WorkSession model for better readability.

2. **User-WorkSession Relationship**: Added a missing `workSessions()` relationship method to the User model, which allows proper relationship navigation between users and their work sessions.

3. **Handling Deleted Users**: Modified the WorkSession controller to include soft-deleted users in the query using `withTrashed()`. This ensures that work sessions belonging to deleted users still appear in the work sessions list.

4. **Null Safety**: Added null checks in the WorkSessionsExport class and blade template to handle cases where users or branches might be null, preventing potential "property of null" errors.

5. **Eager Loading Optimization**: Improved the eager loading of relationships in the WorkSession controller to reduce database queries and improve performance.

## Technical Details

### User Model Enhancement
Added a proper relationship method for work sessions in the User model:
```php
public function workSessions(): HasMany
{
    return $this->hasMany(\App\Models\Domain\Entities\WorkSession::class);
}
```

### Handling Soft-Deleted Users
Modified the queries to include soft-deleted users:
```php
WorkSession::with(['user' => function($q) {
    $q->withTrashed(); // Include deleted users
}, 'user.branch'])
```

### Error Prevention in Blade Template
Added null checks to prevent errors when displaying user information:
```blade
{{ $session->user->name ?? 'Unknown User' }}
{{ $session->user->email ?? 'No Email' }}
```

## Recommendations

1. Consider adding more comprehensive error handling for edge cases in the work sessions management.

2. Add validation to ensure that work session data is always consistent, especially for login/logout timestamps.

3. Consider adding additional filters, such as filtering by date ranges or specific time periods (e.g., this week, this month, etc.).
