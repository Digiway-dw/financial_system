# Work Sessions Timer Enhancement

## Changes Made

1. **Always-Visible Timer**: 
   - Modified the session timer to be always visible to users from the moment they log in
   - Timer displays the remaining time until automatic logout (5 minutes)
   - Context-aware timer placement:
     - Dashboard-specific timer in the header
     - Dynamically created floating timer for non-dashboard pages
   - Removed static placeholder in favor of dynamic timer creation

2. **Improved Visual Feedback**:
   - Timer has consistent styling with clear indication of time remaining
   - Color changes as timeout approaches:
     - Blue when more than 1 minute remains
     - Yellow/orange warning when less than 1 minute remains
     - Red warning when less than 30 seconds remain
   - Timer updates every second with precise countdown

3. **User Interaction**:
   - Users can click on the timer at any time to reset the 5-minute countdown
   - Clear instructions "Click to extend session" are always visible
   - Timer responds to all forms of user activity (mouse, keyboard, scroll, touch)

4. **Robustness Improvements**:
   - Fixed timing issues (corrected milliseconds calculations)
   - Improved DOM manipulation to prevent duplicate timers
   - Added fallback mechanisms for when elements aren't available
   - Enhanced error handling and logging
   - Prevention of simultaneous timers (only one active at a time)
   - Added initialization protection to prevent duplicated event listeners

## Technical Details

- Timer detection logic handles multiple scenarios:
  1. Dashboard page: Uses the styled dashboard timer, hides global placeholder
  2. Other pages: Uses the global timer placeholder
  3. Fallback: Creates a new timer if neither exists
- Timer updates occur every second to show accurate countdown
- Proper error handling for browser events and API communication
- Fallback mechanisms for API endpoint communication
- Debug script helps identify and troubleshoot timer issues

## Benefits

1. **Enhanced User Experience**:
   - Users always know exactly how much time they have before being logged out
   - No surprises when session expires
   - Easy way to extend session without having to perform other actions
   - Consistent appearance across all pages

2. **Improved Security**:
   - Maintains secure automatic logout feature after inactivity
   - Ensures users are aware of potential session expiration
   - Provides clear visual indication of security measures
   - Handles tab switching and browser minimization appropriately

3. **Technical Stability**:
   - Fallback mechanisms to handle API failures
   - Consistent display across different pages and situations
   - Clean code structure for easier maintenance
   - Improved error handling and debugging

## Testing Instructions
1. Login to the application
2. Navigate to the dashboard and verify the integrated timer shows "Session expiring in: 5:00"
3. Navigate to other pages and verify the timer appears in the top-right corner
4. Wait to see the timer count down on various pages
5. Test clicking on the timer to reset it back to 5:00
6. Verify that only one timer is visible at a time (no duplicates)
7. Check browser console for any JavaScript errors
8. Test tab switching and returning after various intervals
9. Test with different user activity patterns to ensure timer extends appropriately
