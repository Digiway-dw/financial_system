# Agent Authorization Rules Implementation Summary

This document outlines how the agent authorization requirements have been implemented in the financial system.

## Agent Requirements and Implementation

### 1. Access his own Agent Dashboard only

**Implementation:**
- `AgentPolicy.php` includes `viewAgentDashboard()` method that only returns true for agents
- `AgentDashboardAccess.php` middleware checks if user is an agent and restricts access to other dashboards
- Gate `view-agent-dashboard` is defined in `AuthorizationServiceProvider.php`
- The middleware redirects agents attempting to access other dashboards to the agent dashboard

### 2. View only transactions that he personally created

**Implementation:**
- In `ListTransactions.php`, agent's `agent_id` is added to the filters before querying transactions
- `AgentPolicy.php` includes `viewTransaction()` method that checks if the transaction's agent_id matches the user's id
- Gates like `view-own-transactions` and `view-other-employees-data` in `AuthorizationServiceProvider.php`
- UI in `transactions/index.blade.php` shows indicators that agents only see their own transactions

### 3. Create new transactions

**Implementation:**
- `AgentPolicy.php` includes `createTransaction()` method that allows agents to create transactions
- Gates `create-transactions` allows all users (including agents) to create transactions
- Gate `create-cash-transactions` specifically restricts cash transactions for agents
- Agent dashboard includes quick action links for Send Money and Receive Money transactions
- Cash transaction button is hidden from agents in the UI with `@can('create-cash-transactions')` directive

### 4. View balance of mobile lines assigned to him only

**Implementation:**
- `AgentPolicy.php` includes `viewLineBalance()` method that checks if the line is assigned to the agent
- Agent dashboard shows "Your Lines Overview" section with lines assigned to the agent
- `ViewLineBalanceAndUsage` use case is used in the Dashboard component to fetch only the agent's lines

### 5. Know his transaction count and commission earned

**Implementation:**
- Transaction statistics cards in `transactions/index.blade.php` display:
  - Total Transactions (with "Your transactions only" label for agents)
  - Total Volume (with "Your volume only" label for agents)
  - Commission information (protected by `view-commission-data` gate but visible to agents for their own data)
- Agent dashboard shows "Your Total Transferred Amount" card with the total volume of transactions

### 6. Cannot delete or edit transactions that are not his own

**Implementation:**
- `AgentPolicy.php` includes:
  - `editTransaction()` method that checks if the transaction's agent_id matches the user's id
  - `deleteTransaction()` method that checks if the transaction's agent_id matches the user's id
- Gates `edit-own-transactions`, `edit-all-transactions`, and `delete-transactions` control these permissions
- In the transaction list UI, Edit/Delete buttons are conditionally displayed based on these permissions
- UI code in `transactions/index.blade.php` checks permissions with `@can` and `@elsecan` directives

### 7. Cannot view company-wide profit or financial reports

**Implementation:**
- `AgentPolicy.php` includes `viewProfitReports()` method that returns false for agents
- Gate `view-profit-reports` specifically denies access to agents
- Middleware in `AgentDashboardAccess.php` prevents access to financial report routes
- UI elements for financial reports are not shown to agents

### 8. Cannot modify Safe balance or Line balance

**Implementation:**
- `AgentPolicy.php` includes `modifyBalances()` method that returns false for agents
- Gate `modify-balances` in `AuthorizationServiceProvider.php` denies agents access
- Middleware in `AgentDashboardAccess.php` prevents access to safe or line balance modification routes
- UI elements for modifying balances are not displayed to agents

### 9. Cannot perform CRUD operations on users

**Implementation:**
- `UserPolicy.php` restricts agent access to user operations:
  - Agents can only view their own profile, not other users
  - Agents cannot create, delete, or update other users
- `AgentPolicy.php` includes `manageUsers()` and `viewUserList()` methods that return false for agents
- Gates like `manage-users`, `view-user-list`, `create-users`, `edit-users`, and `delete-users` control these permissions
- Middleware in `AgentDashboardAccess.php` prevents access to user management routes
- Detailed documentation in `AGENT_USER_MANAGEMENT_RESTRICTIONS.md`

## Verification

All requirements have been properly implemented both at the backend and UI levels:

1. **Backend Authorization**: Policies, Gates, and Middleware restrict access to only permitted actions
2. **UI Authorization**: Blade directives (`@can`, `@cannot`, etc.) hide restricted actions
3. **Data Filtering**: Repository filters ensure agents only see their own data
4. **Clear UI Indicators**: Labels clearly show when data is limited to the agent's own information

The implementation follows the principle of defense in depth, with multiple layers of protection:
- Repository-level filtering
- Business logic authorization checks
- Policy-based permissions
- Gate definitions
- Middleware route protection
- UI conditional rendering

This ensures that agent users are properly restricted in accordance with the business requirements.
