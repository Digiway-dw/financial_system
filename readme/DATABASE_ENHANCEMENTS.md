```

## Migration Strategy

### 1. Pre-Migration
- Backup current database
- Run data consistency checks
- Inform users of maintenance window

### 2. Migration Execution
```bash
# Run migrations in order
php artisan migrate --path=database/migrations/2025_07_08_100000_enhance_database_structure.php
php artisan migrate --path=database/migrations/2025_07_08_100001_add_database_constraints.php
# ... continue with all migration files in order
```

### 3. Post-Migration
- Run enhanced system seeder
- Verify data integrity
- Test key functionality
- Monitor performance

### 4. Seeding Enhanced Data
```bash
php artisan db:seed --class=EnhancedSystemSeeder
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Constraint Violations**: Check data consistency before applying constraints
2. **Performance Issues**: Analyze query execution plans and index usage
3. **Storage Space**: Monitor table sizes, especially audit tables
4. **Memory Usage**: Optimize view queries for large datasets

### Resolution Steps

1. **Check Migration Status**:
```bash
php artisan migrate:status
```

2. **Rollback if Needed**:
```bash
php artisan migrate:rollback --step=1
```

3. **Verify Database Integrity**:
```sql
CHECK TABLE users, transactions, branches, customers, safes, lines;
```
