# Agent Authorization UI Implementation

This document outlines how agent authorization rules have been implemented in the UI to ensure that users with the "agent" role can only access and perform actions allowed by the business requirements.

## Overview

The authorization system has been implemented at two levels:
1. **Backend Authorization**: Using Laravel's Gate facade and policies to restrict access
2. **UI Authorization**: Conditionally rendering UI elements based on the user's role and permissions

## UI Implementation Details

### Transaction Index Page

1. **Action Buttons**:
   - The "Cash Transaction" button is only visible to users with the 'create-cash-transactions' permission
   - Agents can only see Send and Receive buttons, which align with their limited role

2. **Transaction Table Actions**:
   - Edit action: Only shown if the user has 'edit-all-transactions' permission or if they have 'edit-own-transactions' permission and are the creator of the transaction
   - Delete action: Only shown to users with 'delete-transactions' permission
   
3. **Filtering Options**:
   - Branch filter: Disabled for agents who can only see their own branch data
   - Employee filter: Disabled for agents who can only see their own transactions
   - Explanatory text is shown to clarify why these options are disabled

4. **Statistics Cards**:
   - All statistics cards show agent-specific context ("Your transactions only", etc.)
   - Commission data is only visible to users with the 'view-commission-data' permission

### Agent Dashboard

1. **Enhanced UI**:
   - Added contextual information to make it clear this is an agent-specific view
   - Added status indicators that show whether lines are active
   - Added agent-specific quick actions that only show permitted actions

2. **Agent-Only Data**:
   - Clearly labeled sections show data that is specific to the logged-in agent
   - Total line balance, transferred amount, and pending transactions are highlighted
   - Line overview table shows only lines assigned to the current agent

### Main Dashboard

1. **Transaction Action Buttons**:
   - Wrapped in `@can('create-transactions')` check to ensure only authorized users can see them
   - Agents will only see buttons for actions they are allowed to perform

## Verification Steps

To verify the agent authorization UI is working correctly:

1. Log in as an agent user
2. Confirm that:
   - Only agent-specific actions are visible
   - Statistics show only data related to the agent's transactions
   - Edit/delete actions only appear for transactions created by the agent
   - Filter options for branches and other employees are disabled

3. Log in as an admin or manager
4. Confirm that:
   - All actions are visible
   - Statistics show data according to the user's permission level
   - Edit/delete actions appear according to permissions
   - Filter options are enabled based on permissions

## Business Rules Enforced

- Agents can only see their own transactions
- Agents cannot perform cash transactions
- Agents cannot edit transactions created by other users
- Agents cannot delete any transactions
- Agents cannot view commission data unless specifically permitted
- Agents cannot filter by branch or other employees

These UI changes, combined with the backend authorization rules, ensure comprehensive enforcement of the agent-specific authorization requirements.
