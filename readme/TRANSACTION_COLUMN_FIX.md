# Transaction System Fix - Removing Non-Existent Column References

## Issue Summary

Several components in the transaction system were referencing columns that don't exist in the `transactions` table. This was causing `MissingAttributeException` errors when trying to access transaction details.

The error messages were:
```
Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\MissingAttributeException
The attribute [line_mobile_number] either does not exist or was not retrieved for model [App\Models\Domain\Entities\Transaction].
```

```
Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\MissingAttributeException
The attribute [agent_name] either does not exist or was not retrieved for model [App\Models\Domain\Entities\Transaction].
```

## Root Cause

The `line_mobile_number` and `agent_name` columns were likely removed from the `transactions` table during previous database schema updates, but references to these columns remained in several files, including:

1. Transaction edit component (`app/Livewire/Transactions/Edit.php`)
2. Transaction views (`resources/views/livewire/transactions/edit.blade.php` and `create-fields.blade.php`)
3. Export functionality (`app/Exports/TransactionsExport.php`)
4. Customer view (`resources/views/livewire/customers/view.blade.php`)
5. Safe cash movement use case (`app/Application/UseCases/MoveSafeCash.php`)

## Implemented Fixes

The following changes were made to fix these issues:

### 1. Transaction Edit Component

- Removed the `lineMobileNumber` property from the component
- Removed the property initialization in the `mount()` method
- Removed the property from the transaction update array
- Fixed access to `agent_name` by using the agent relationship: `$transaction->agent->name`
- Removed `agent_name` from the update array since it doesn't exist in the table

### 2. Transaction Views

- Removed the line mobile number field from the transaction edit form
- Removed the line mobile number display from the transaction receipt modal
- Replaced references in the customer view with `$transaction->line->mobile_number`

### 3. Export Functionality

- Removed the line mobile number field from the transaction export mapping

### 4. Safe Cash Movement

- Removed the line mobile number field from the transaction attributes array

## Potential Impact and Considerations

- Users can now access and edit transactions without errors
- Line mobile numbers are now accessed through the proper relationship (`$transaction->line->mobile_number`)
- Agent names are now accessed through the proper relationship (`$transaction->agent->name`)
- The transaction record no longer attempts to store this data directly, instead using the relationships

## Best Practices Moving Forward

1. When removing columns from the database schema, ensure all references to those columns are also removed
2. Maintain a comprehensive list of model attributes and their meanings
3. Use proper relationships instead of duplicating data across tables
4. Run automated tests after schema changes to catch these types of issues early
